							<h2>First time like first grade</h2>
							<p>So, it is also interesting for you to find out how our heroine started her way? Then read on.</p>
							<blockquote>“I've been in webcam for 4 years. Before that I was an ordinary student. One girl in the social network advised me to go to the webcam and I thought, why not try? At first it was scary to send my photo to the site for models, but the girl convinced me that there was nothing to be afraid of. It turned out that this passport is needed to confirm that I was already 18 years old. So I got into this industry. At first, my earnings were not the highest (I earned about $ 400 in the first month), but I just learned to interact with the audience, I watched how other models behave. Then I began to earn a stable $ 1000 per month"</blockquote>

							<h2>Why chose work webcam model?</h2>
							<p>
								<blockquote>“I don’t have a relationship with webcams as to work, for me this is a great opportunity to communicate with the audience, show myself and make money. From the advantages that I want to highlight, we can name the following.
<br>1) You can work at home. It is very convenient, I work that way.
<br>2) Flexible and free schedule.
<br>3) Lack of physical contact with strangers.
<br>4) My own boss.
<br>Perhaps for me these are the most important benefits. Now I understand that I could hardly fully work at another job and even realized that I don’t like the profession I was studying for.”</blockquote>

							<h2>The most expensive gift</h2>
							<p>Communication came to an end and there were only a few interesting questions that were prepared for the girl.</p>
							<blockquote>“I do not like to receive gifts, but I like to make them myself. I made the most expensive gift myself when I bought my own apartment. I would hardly be able to make myself such a gift if I were not a webcam model. I am not going to give up my activities, but, frankly, it’s impossible to combine webcam and personal life, because I’m afraid to tell the young man that I’m a web model. It seems to me difficult to find a person who can accept my activities.”</blockquote>
